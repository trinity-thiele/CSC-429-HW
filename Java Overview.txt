Java Overview

Java is a widely used, high-level programming language that is known for its portability, object-oriented structure, and versatility. Developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle) in the mid-1990s, Java allows developers to write code once and run it anywhere, thanks to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This feature is commonly referred to as "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA).

Java syntax is similar to C++, making it familiar to many developers. It is primarily used in building web applications, Android apps, enterprise-level software, and systems requiring portability across platforms.

Key features of Java:

Platform Independence: Java code is compiled into bytecode, which can be executed on any machine with a JVM.
Object-Oriented: Java emphasizes the use of objects, which makes the language modular, flexible, and scalable.
Rich API: Java offers a large collection of libraries for building networked applications, user interfaces, databases, and more.
Multithreading: Java has built-in support for multithreading, which allows for the efficient execution of multiple tasks simultaneously.
Automatic Memory Management: The Java runtime environment handles garbage collection, meaning developers donâ€™t have to manually manage memory allocation and deallocation.
Overall, Java's stability, security, and vast ecosystem make it a popular choice for large-scale applications and enterprise solutions.
